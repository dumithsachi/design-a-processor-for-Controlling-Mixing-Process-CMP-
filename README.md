There is a wide range of industries that depend on mixing ingredients. Pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries are some examples of such industries. In these industries, mixing is an integral part of their production process.
For mass production, they must mix ingredients based on the recipe of a production item. Accordingly, a few ingredients will be delivered to the mixer at once or at different time intervals. In the process, it should be able to control several important factors such as ingredient type, weight and volume. Further, the mixing process start time, mixing speed, duration, temperature, pressure, and energy are some significant factors for a mixer that should be controlled and monitored. Moreover, there may be continuous mixing processes after adding other ingredients, depending on the need of the product. However, the mixing process and the factors may vary on the industry and their production.
Your task is to design a processor for Controlling Mixing Process (CMP). Accordingly, various industries should be able to use the processor, CMP, to manufacture their mixing machines for different production lines. Your main task is to design the processor, where a programmer should be able to write simple programs to control the mixing process. The processor should control and monitor the mixing process according to the set program
